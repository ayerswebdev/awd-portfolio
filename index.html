          <p class="t-pad">
            I am a front-end web developer currently working as a high school math teacher in
            Warsaw, Illinois. I'm in the process of getting job-ready so that I can make the jump
            into computer science as a career rather than a side job (and move to Vegas). When I'm not preparing
            lessons or building websites, you're most likely to find me at the golf course or the
            casino!
            </thead>
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I have experience in the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (vanilla or jQuery). I am also proficient
            in the use of CSS preprocessors such as SASS and front-end frameworks such as
            Bootstrap. I'm a fast learner and I love to learn new things, so if your project requires me to learn something else I'm
            all for it!

                I originally created a local weather application without search capability as part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum. Later, as my skills grew, I decided that I would attempt
                to allow the user to search for a location and get the weather there. The background is also dynamic based on weather conditions and (in some cases) time of day.

              <p class="text-left">
                At my first teaching job, I was the teacher in charge of the school's chess club. There was a 25 minute time during each day during which the club met, but we found that many games
                weren't getting done in that time because people were playing too slowly. So I built this timer and had students use it to ensure that the pace of play was quick. In this application, the two players
                agree to a time per turn, then set it and switch turns with a button press. Easy and effective!

                I'm a little too young to remember when these games were new to the market, but they're still fun to play (and build) today! On desktop, I opted for a more retro style based on images
                of the original game that I found online. On mobile, I later decided to redo the design in a way that makes it a little more user-friendly for smaller screens. Everyone should be able
                to enjoy this classic, right?

                We've all played tic-tac-toe before. It's a very simple game - two players try to make three marks in a row on a 3x3 square. Most players eventually grow out of it, though, because
                once you have the basic strategy mastered you can't lose. I have crafted a master tic-tac-toe AI - beat it and I'll do your website for free!

                The Pomodoro Technique of time management is a technique in which you work (typically) 25 minutes non-stop, then take a five-minute break. It's a very effective way of keeping
                yourself productive, and I have created a customizable Pomodoro Clock in this application. Try it out, and watch your productivity skyrocket (well, hopefully)!

                With my math background, building a calculator was way more exciting than it probably should have been. I took care to make sure that this one functions just like the ones I used
                as a kid, even going beyond the project spec by adding a fully-functioning memory system. This calculator may not hold a candle to a TI-84 (yet; I want to go back and put in some
                more functions when I get time), but I'm proud of it anyway!
